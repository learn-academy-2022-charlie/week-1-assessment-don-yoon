# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer:
  
  - Git is the version control software used to retrieve and share data from Github which is a centralized "hub" for storing information. Multiple individuals can then use the stored information to make the necessary edits before merging into a single unified repository. This allows many individuals to work on changes while keeping a stable version for backup.

  Researched answer:

  - Github sometimes gets confused with Git. GitHub is an internet hosting platform for software devlopments and uses Git for version control. Version control is used to manage what changes are made to large bodies of information. Where a single change can cause irreperable damage, each change would be monitored to before being allowed to merge with the actual product. This process has been done already many times to great effect while at Learn, allowing us as students to make mistakes on our own branches without damaging other students' files. GitHub offers many features useful for collaborating between many people such as bug tracking and management of tasks.

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer:

  - Many operators return a Boolean value, which is simply true or false. Logical operators such as && and ||, relational operators such as > greater than, < less than, and === strict equality all return Boolean values. In turn, I have used these results to create decision trees when creating conditional statements. True or false ouputs make it easy to quickly make many simple decision.

  Researched answer:

  - As mentioned above, logical and relational operators give boolean values. When these operators are used with data, the become what are known as Boolean expressions. When evaluated these expressions give a Boolean value. An example of this can be seen very commonly in conditional statments. When using these operators, we create a Boolean expression that will be evaulted in the conditional statement which will allow us to execute the desired codeblock depending on which condition was fulfilled.




3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer:

  - An index is a representation of the location of the value in a certain piece of data. The index will start at 0 and will end at one less than the length of the given piece of data. We have used this in class for both strings and arrays. When used for strings, it is referring to a character within the string. When used for an array, it is referring to an element in the array. So index tells us wheich element to look at and the value is the content at the given element.

  Researched answer:

  - There are other index bases. In JavaScript we are familiar with 0-base indexing, however there are 1-based indexing and n-based indexing. The base can be chosen and can even go into negative indexing. Arrays can have multiple dimensions so multiple indices can be used to show where an element is located in a multi dimensional array.

4. What is iteration?

  Your answer:

  It is a process where a certain block of code or function is repeatedly executed. It is useful when working with large arrays or large sets of data. It lets us automate the more tedious aspects of programming and utilize the strength of our machines.

  Researched answer:

  A few important things I forgot to mention is that iteration in programming repeats a set of instructions until a certain CONDITION is met. This condition in JavaScript is determined by conditional statements using if, else, else if, and the iteration is done using for loops.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer:

  Pair programming is a way for two individuals to work on a single project. One person is the driver and the other is the navigator. The driver is the one physically inputing code into the editor. This prevents too many changes from occuring all at once making it easier to keep track of what is going on. The navigator assists the driver in keeping the bigger picture. It is easy to get tunnel vision when trying to get a certain piece of code to execute. The navigator can help maneuver around any blocks in the projects by reaching out to other resources while the project continues.

  Researched answer:

  There are many benefits to pair programming as I have mentioned, but it is important to keep in mind the negative aspects that may arise during pair progamming as well. Individuals forced into pair programming may also perform below their usual standards. Forcing people and expecting them to grow into their role may be deterimental. The different skill level pairs may also prove to be problematic. While a high level and a beginner pair can have great synergy, a less assertive beginner may be unlikely to question the methods of the expert and passively watch what is happening. It is important to keep both enganged in the process to yield best results.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions:
Higher-order functions in JavaScript are built in methods that take a function as an argument.
"LEARN academy syllabus"
2. Jest:
It is an open-source framework used for testing. 
"jestjs.io"
3. Objects:
Objects are similar to variables in that they contain data, but objects can contain many values (arrays).
"w3schools objects"
4. Method:
Actions performed on objects.
"w3schools object methods"
5. Classes:
It is the template for objects. Just like declaring a variable, objects are declared and there is a format that must be followed to show how that object is structured.
